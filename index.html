<p> Terrain created in World Machine and imported into MapMagic as a heightmap with a bitmap for textures. Used MapMagic to place trees, objects, and grass, and to create the beach shoreline. Manually edited in the road and bridge. The best effect here is the lighting which I highly modified based on research. For example, there is next to zero ambient lighting. It's 99% direct lighing from a single source turned extremely high but with linear color space and filmic color grading to remove the typical whiteout. </p>

<p> Old visual effects project shown before. 95% of this was tweaking the visuals and post procesing to make it look as beautiful as possible. For example, at first, the rays looked extremely thin, aliased, and dull. I kept modifying the files and post processing to get the bright, rewarding look you see. I also dealt shaders and cameras to create the triangular portals. The visual effects spawn in front of the player and follow them infinitely. </p>
